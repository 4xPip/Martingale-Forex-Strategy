# What Is a Forex Martingale EA?
A Forex Martingale EA is an automated trading system that uses the Martingale strategy. The basic idea of this strategy is straightforward: after a losing trade, the trader doubles their position size to recover their losses and make a profit when the market moves their way. In Forex trading, this process is handled by an Expert Advisor (EA), which is a program that automatically places and manages trades based on set rules.

# Working of Martingale Strategy in Forex Trading
The Martingale strategy works by doubling your trade size after each losing trade. Here’s how it functions step by step:

| Trade #  | LotSize | Result | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  |  0.1  |  Profit  |  initial trade  |
| 2  |  0.1  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |
| 3  |  0.2  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |
| 4  |  0.4  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |
| 5  |  0.8  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |
| 6  |  0.16  |  Profit  |  Closed all previous trades together on profit  |
| 7  |  0.1  |  Loss  |  Lotsize resets back to 0.1 because previous Trade-Group is closed on profit  |
| 8  |  0.2  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |
| 9  |  0.4  |  Loss  |  let's double next trade  |

1. **First Trade:** The 4xPip EA (Expert Advisor) opens a trade based on its rules, such as buying or selling a currency pair based on market conditions.
2. **Doubling After a Loss:** If this trade loses, the EA will double the size of the next trade.
3. **Repeating the Process:** This doubling continues with each loss until a winning trade occurs.
4. **Making a Profit:** When a winning trade finally occurs, The profit from this winning trade covers all previous losses and adds a small gain. After that, the EA resets back to the original trade size and repeats the process.

The Martingale strategy assumes that the market will eventually turn in your favor, but it carries significant risks, which we will cover in the next section.
